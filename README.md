# Web-Scraper-Amazon
This is a simple Amazon Fresh web scraper that finds and prints the products present on the home page.

The Amazon Fresh home page looks like this:
![asdf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46697997/121805811-6bac8480-cc6a-11eb-8e59-a8ea774a2040.png)

Libraries used in the project are:
1. Selenium
2. Pandas

To run this script simply load it on your machine and run it. No special requirements except the libraries.
The O/P of this should be in the format:
1. ID
2. Name of the product
3. MRP
4. Price to customer
5. Availability
6. Listing place

Something like this:

This is a crude way to do this, so drop any suggestions if any and i'll try to add them.
