# Web-Scraper-Amazon
This is a simple Amazon Fresh web scraper that finds and prints the products present on the home page.

The Amazon Fresh home page looks like this:

Libraries used in the project are:
1. Selenium
2. Pandas

To run this script simply load it on your machine and run it. No special requirements except the libraries.

This is a crude way to do this, so drop any suggestions if any and i'll try to add them.
